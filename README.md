# This guide will explain:
- What a Web API is
- How to get a Twitter API Key
- How to get an MSTranslator Key
- How to use the Twitter API
- How to use the MSTranslator API
- How to automate your Twitter bot

# What will the finished bot look like?
Our end product will be able to pull tweets from Twitter based on specific criteria, and retweet them with the translated text in the comment. 

# What is a Web API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's quite a mouthful and a fancy name for a relatively simple concept. In one sentence, an API is an interface that lets a program that you are writing control or access another program that some other person wrote. Now why would this be useful?

Let's think of an analogy. Everyday I drive a car and through some miracle of engineering neither I nor the car spontaneously combusts. I also get to my destination without many problems. Though fascinating, I do not really care precisely how every aspect of my car works. I just want to drive and get to where I need to go. The interface of the car would be the steering wheel, gearshift, gas pedal, break pedal, and all of the other controls that let me drive my car. Now, say I wanted to teach my good robot friend, Killroy, how to drive a car. When building him I would not have to teach him about the inner workings of the car. I would just show him how to use the "interface" (the gas pedal, steering wheel etc...)!

This is basically what we will be doing when using Twitter's API. We don't necessarily care about the deep inner workings of Twitter. We will just be using its API which will allow us to use Twitter's platform in our own programs.
